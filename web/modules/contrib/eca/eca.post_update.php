 *
 * The old raw data is read as plain configuration, because the "eca_model"
 * config entity type that used to describe it no longer exists in ECA 3.1. That
 * also means no schema describes those objects any more, so they are deleted
 * once their content has been carried over, rather than left behind as
 * schema-less orphans.
